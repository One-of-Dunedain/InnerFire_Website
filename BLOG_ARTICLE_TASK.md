### First 100–150 words (intro)
Include:
- primary (once)
- “best breathing apps” (once)
- 1–2 secondary intents (sleep/anxiety/free)

### H2 headings
Each H2 should contain a strong secondary keyword (from section mapping above).
Do NOT repeat the exact same phrase in every header.

### Table section
Use competitor names + “best for” labels.
Keywords here should be subtle:
- “best for anxiety”, “best for sleep”, “best free option”, “best interactive app”

### FAQ
Use question-style variants (from Google PAA / your cluster “Questions” tab):
- “Do breathing apps really work?”
- “What are the best free breathing apps?”
- “Is there a breathing app without counting?”
- “What’s the best breathing app for sleep?”

## 7) Don’ts (to avoid killing intent)
- Don’t choose “breathing app” as primary for a comparison post (intent is too broad).
- Don’t chase unrelated high-volume ideas (e.g., “holotropic breathwork”) inside this article.
- Don’t create separate pages for tiny one-off keywords now; keep them as sections.

## 😍 Outcome
- 1 page targets 1 main intent: best breathwork apps
- The same page also ranks for long-tail via sections: anxiety, sleep, free, timer alternatives, interactive feedback
