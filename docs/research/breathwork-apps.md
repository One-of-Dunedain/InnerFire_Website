## 2. InnerFire positioning data

### Competitive advantage
- InnerFire is positioned as a **closed-loop breath-response product**: the user blows into the phone and the experience changes in real time (fire visuals + sound + haptics), instead of following a static timer.
- Most competitors above are **guided content libraries or paced timers**. They cue breathing but generally do not react to the user\'s actual breath signal in the moment.
- Closest competitors by feel (not mechanism):
  - **Breathwrk** (strong protocol guidance and multisensory cues)
  - **Othership** (immersive session design and state-shift positioning)
  - **Wim Hof Method** (method-centric breath rounds with strong engagement)
- What InnerFire does that no competitor in this set does:
  - Uses **phone microphone input as direct control signal** for the core loop.
  - Binds **visual, audio, and haptic outputs** to the same live breath input.
  - Reduces counting/friction by replacing step-following with **immediate embodied feedback**.

### Gaps
- Almost no pages explain **real-time breath biofeedback** vs simple guided pacing.
- Limited discussion of "no-counting" use cases for users under acute stress.
