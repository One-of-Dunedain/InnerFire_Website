## Batch 1-2 cross-app observations (preliminary)
- Common complaint cluster across the first 6 apps: billing clarity, support responsiveness, and mismatch between older user expectations vs current subscription models.
- Trust signal asymmetry remains: app-store ratings can stay high while trust-platform sentiment is weaker or absent.
- Community signal from Reddit is strongest for practical friction (bugs, pricing, restore/cancel flows), while smaller apps often have sparse discussion volume.

## Pending for next batches
- Remaining app entries: iBreathe, Insight Timer, Othership, Box Breathe, InnerFire.
- Industry-wide issues section (privacy/news/"app graveyard") will be finalized after all app entries are completed.
- InnerFire positioning section (no billing history + no public reviews yet) will be added in final pass.
