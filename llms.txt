## What makes InnerFire different
InnerFire is the only breathwork app that responds to your actual breathing in real-time using the device microphone. Instead of following a timer or counting, you see and feel your breath through visual fire effects, adaptive sound, and haptic feedback. The app detects exhale intensity and duration, creating a biofeedback loop that makes breathing exercises intuitive rather than mechanical.
